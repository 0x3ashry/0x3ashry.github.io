## Web - Wordle

Wordle was an easy web challange that is inspired from the **Wordle** game.

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Wordle.png)

Basically the game rules is that there is an English 5-letter word you must guess it through try and error, You have only 6 tries. In each try letters are colored by 3 colors Red, Orange and Green. Red means that this letter is incorrect, Orange means it is correct but in the wrong order and green means it is correct and in the right order in the original word.

You must use these informations try after try to guess the right word.\

Let's move to the challange...

It is said in the challange to access `http://byuctf.xyz:40003` 

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Wordle_1.png)

I tried the first word `AUDIO` but it gave me a hash...

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Wordle_2.png)

There was a zip file attached with the challange so I extracted it, it contains 2 files for the website source code:

- app.py
- utils.py

There was nothing useful except in the `utils.py` I found `getHashString` function:

```python
def getHashString(guess_status):
    # guess_status[g_pos] = {"letter":g_char, "state":1}
    passString = ''
    for i in guess_status:
        if i["state"] == 0:
            passString += 'â¬›'
        elif i["state"] == 1:
            passString += 'ðŸŸ¨'
        elif i["state"] == 2:
            passString += 'ðŸŸ©'
        else:
            passString += '?'

        hashString = hashlib.md5(passString.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    return hashString
```

It takes my guessed word and append its color to passString and then has that string and return it and this is the hash which I saw on the website, instead of coloring the letters themselves they throw a hash.

First I generated all the possible combinations from 0:2.

0 is equivalent to Red
1 is equivalent to Orange
2 is equivalent to Green

and then maipulate `getHashString` a little bit so that it deals with guess_status as numbers instead of a dictionary and then append the generated hash to all_hashes.

function `hash_to_colors` take the hash and search for it in all hashes and return the corrosponding combination of colors (5 digit integer from 0:2)

```python
import hashlib

def getHashString(guess_status):
    # guess_status[g_pos] = {"letter":g_char, "state":1}
    passString = ''
    hashString = ''
    for i in guess_status:
        if i == '0':
            passString += 'â¬›'
        elif i == '1':
            passString += 'ðŸŸ¨'
        elif i == '2':
            passString += 'ðŸŸ©'

        hashString = hashlib.md5(passString.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    return hashString


combinations = []
for a in range(3):
    for b in range(3):
        for c in range(3):
            for d in range(3):
                for e in range(3):
                    value = str(a) + str(b) + str(c) + str(d) + str(e)
                    combinations.append(value)

all_hashes = []
for i in range(len(combinations)):
    all_hashes.append(getHashString(combinations[i]))

def hash_to_colors(hashh, all_hashes, colors):
    for i in range(len(all_hashes)):
        if hashh == all_hashes[i]:
            return colors[i]


# print(hash_to_colors('', all_hashes, combinations)) # 1st Try
# print(hash_to_colors('', all_hashes, combinations)) # 2nd Try
# print(hash_to_colors('', all_hashes, combinations)) # 3rd Try
# print(hash_to_colors('', all_hashes, combinations)) # 4th Try
# print(hash_to_colors('', all_hashes, combinations)) # 5th Try
# print(hash_to_colors('', all_hashes, combinations)) # 6th Try
```
I took the generated hash and paste it in `hash_to_colors` and it gave me `02000` which means that only letter `U` is correct and in the right order

I used a website to help me solve wordle game faster: `https://word.tips/`, It gave me a lot of options to try next discarding the bad letters.

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Wordle_4.png)

I tried `HUSKY` next and continue the same process...

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Wordle_7.png)

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM !!! We got the flag `byuctf{b@c0n_grease}`

## Cryptography - XQR

XQR was a hard rated cryptography challange and it was in a whole another level.

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/XQR.png)

It doesn't contain except one massive image contain thousands of QR Codes

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/XQR_1.png)

I first tried to read the first QR Code but it gave me `85TK6eDfb{SXQfvR70VXX` !!!

Through trial and error I got that the size of each qr code is 27 pixels length and width, so i thought that cutting the whole image into smaller QR codes will make it easier

```python
from PIL import Image

imggg = Image.open('xqr.png')
inc = 27
for i in range(0, 2727 , 27):
    for j in range(0, 2727, 27):
        box = (j, i, j+27, i+27) # left, top, right, buttom
        img2 = imggg.crop(box)
        img2.save(r'QRCodes/myimage_' + str(i) + '_' + str(j) + '_cropped.jpg')
```

Now I have `10,201 QR Codes` stored in file called `QRCodes`, And I stucked for a while...

Then I realized from the name of the challange that `XQR` is near to `XOR` so what if I XORed all the QR codes together...

I started with reading them using `cv2` library from python-opencv and then in order to make my trick work I changed the readed image to binary 0 and 1, black and white pixels. Then I XORed each pixel with the same pixels in all the other 10,201 qr codes and saved it, Then displaying the result shows:



```python
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os

QR_dir = os.listdir(r"QRCodes")
qr_codes = []
for qr in QR_dir:
    gray = cv2.imread("QRCodes/" + qr, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    _, binary = cv2.threshold(gray, 150, 1, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)
    qr_codes.append(binary)

for i in range(27):
    for j in range(27):
        for q in range(len(qr_codes)):
            if q+1 == 10201:
                break
            qr_codes[0][i][j] ^= qr_codes[q+1][i][j]

plt.imshow(qr_codes[0])
plt.show()
```

Scanning it with my phone...

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM !!! We got the flag `byuctf{x0r_i5_u5eful}`



## Miscellaneous - Reconstruct

Reconstruct was a medium miscellaneous challange that was new and challanging to me...

First he gave ma an MD5 hash for the flag to verify that this is the flag before submission.

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Reconstruct.png)

Whatever let's download the file, It is an image containing the flag but was covered with a black bold line...

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Reconstruct_1.png)

At the end of the file, The lower-case Alphabet and the numbers were attached to use them in the process of identifying the flag...

I solved it manually by comparing the sizes of the letters, and here were the steps:

1. The Underscore `_` was obviously so I wrote the flag format as this: 
`byuctf{XXXX_XXXX_XXX_XXXXXXXX_XX_XXXX_X_XXX_XXXXXXXXXXX_XX}`

2. Then I detected the characters with 2 tips down as the `h,n` 
`byuctf{XXXn_XXXh_XhX_XXXXXXXX_XX_XnXX_X_XXn_XXXXnXXXXXX_XX}`

3. The number `1` also was obvious
`byuctf{XXXn_X1Xh_XhX_X1XXXXXX_XX_1nXX_1_XXn_XXXXnXXXXXX_1X}`

4. There were 2 simillar letters which were `t and l` both of them are written nearly close to each other with one small different which is the `t` letter's down tip has a taller curve
`byuctf{XXXn_X1th_thX_l1ttlXXt_XX_1nXX_1_XXn_XXXXnXtXXXt_1t}`

5. The `f` also was pretty obvious
`byuctf{XXXn_X1th_thX_l1ttlXXt_Xf_1nfX_1_XXn_XXXXnXtXXXt_1t}`

6. I was stuck to differentiate between `a,c,e,o,s,u` all of them have a curve and very similar to each other, but the letter `o` have a more perfect circle when you focus more
`byuctf{XXXn_X1th_thX_l1ttlXXt_of_1nfo_1_XXn_XXXXnXtXXXt_1t}`

7. After sometime I noticed that the `v,w`'s tips are little bit more bold and centered in the middle of the letter's place
`byuctf{XvXn_w1th_thX_l1ttlXXt_of_1nfo_1_XXn_XXXXnXtXXXt_1t}`

8. there were remaining tips that are shifted leftward and isn't classified yet, I had no option except the `r` letter which was a smart choice
`byuctf{XvXn_w1th_thX_l1ttlXXt_of_1nfo_1_XXn_rXXXnXtrXXt_1t}`

9. the third word was obvious to be `the`

Now the generated words are: `XvXn with the littlXXt of info i XXn rXXXnXtrXXt it`

XvXn --> can't know what it is
l1ttlXXt --> guessed to be l1ttlest
XXn --> can't know what it is
rXXXnXtrXXt --> I count the number of letters and they happened to be equal to the word `reconstruct` which is the challange name, Bingooooo

Now the flag is byuctf{`XvXn w1th the l1ttlest of 1nfo 1 XXn reconstruct 1t`}
I guessed the word XXn --> can

Then stucked for a while trying words that similar to XvXn and figured out that it is `even`

Now my flag is `byuctf{even_w1th_the_l1ttlest_of_1nfo_1_can_reconstruct_1t}`

To validate it I ran this script to generate the flag's hash and compare it to the one in the description...

```python
def validate(strr, hash):
    strr = hashlib.md5(strr.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    if strr == hash:
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")

def validate2(strr, hash):
    strr = strr[7:-1]
    strr = hashlib.md5(strr.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
    if strr == hash:
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")

flag = "byuctf{even_w1th_the_l1ttlest_of_1nfo_1_can_reconstruct_1t}"

validate(flag,"63b1424fa6fe8aa81d9ce4b5637f7acd")
```

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM !!! The flag was right



## Miscellaneous - Probably

Probably was an easy Miscellaneous challange that uses netcat to connect to byuctf and displays some sort of message...

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Probably.png)

I connected to the server using windows version of netcat:

```bash
nc64.exe byuctf.xyz 40004
```

It displayed a large message and disconnected, rerun it again it displays different undefined message and disconnected

![](/img/CTF/BYUCTF_2022/Probably_1.png)

There was a python script attached with the challange, I opened it and found it does the following:

1. Opens the flag file and read it
2. Calls `random_string` function which changes the characters of the flag according to a random number from 0:1, If the random number < 0.25 the current character remains as it is, else it is replaced with another random character
3. Then the generated string `(new_string)` will be displayed using `pyfiglet.figlet_format` function which displays it in the format we saw in the cmd

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import string
import random
import pyfiglet
from pathlib import Path
import os


def open_file(filename):
    '''
    open a file by name and return the first line
    '''
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        file = []
        for line in f.readlines():
            file.append(line.strip())
        return file


def random_string(s):
    '''
    randomly changes characters in the string
    returns the new string
    '''
    new_string = ''
    for char in s:
        print("Original char = " + char)
        if random.random() < 0.25:
            # print("[1] - " + str(random.random()))
            new_string += char
        else:
            new_char = random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits + "_")
            print("[2] - " + str(new_char))
            new_string += new_char
        print()
    return new_string


def main():
    flag = open_file(os.path.join(os.path.abspath(
        os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'flag.txt'))
    print()
    print(flag)
    print(random_string(flag))
    #print(pyfiglet.figlet_format(random_string(flag)))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If I could store number of strings I can use the fact that there is 25% chance that the actual letter remains as it is and 75% it is replaced with another random letter, So what about generating 20 string and in each character calculate the most appeared character which in most casses will be the actual letter from the flag.

Let's test my theory...

I ran the netcat connection 20 times and wrote the returned string in a separate text file and this was the result:

```

```

Then I wrote a python script that takes each letter and loops on the whole text file get the most appearing letter in this position and so on...


```python
def open_file(filename):
    '''
    open a file by name and return the first line
    '''
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        file = []
        for line in f.readlines():
            file.append(line.strip())
        return file

def decrypt(flags):
    # flags = ['by9ctfi48xz_mku8hhzpheaqceh1p5yp9p9s}', 'ndu7pd{wtg55pxy3dedr2hrngtqhgeehdflm3', 'brunufoohsruai__bujgi5hoaexqaeeu3ocbi', ...etc]
    dict = {}
    flag = ""
    for i in range(len(flags[0])):
        for j in range(len(flags)):
            if flags[j][i] in dict.keys():
                dict[flags[j][i]] += 1
            else:
                dict[flags[j][i]] = 1

        bigger = 0
        bigger_char = ''
        for char in dict:
            if dict[char] > bigger:
                bigger = dict[char]
                bigger_char = char
        flag += bigger_char
        dict = {}
    return flag


enc_flags = open_file(r"encrypted_flags_simplified.txt")
x = decrypt(enc_flags)
print(x)
```

It generated: `byuctfowhat_are_the_chances_3eep3fcs}` which missed the `{` so I replaced it and 
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM !!! The flag was right
